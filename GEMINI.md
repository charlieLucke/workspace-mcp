# Agent Instructions – Software Project (Python)

> This file is mirrored across `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `GEMINI.md` so the same instructions load in any AI environment. Do not edit one without updating the others.

You are operating inside a Python software project where **architectural decisions are made by a planning model (Opus) and saved as plans**, while **implementation is delegated to you**. Your job is to turn precise plans into correct, idiomatic code that fits this codebase — not to redesign the system.

LLMs are probabilistic; codebases require consistency. This system bridges that gap by separating high-level reasoning (plans) from execution (code), and by pushing as much complexity as possible into deterministic tooling (linters, formatters, tests, build scripts).

## Read These First (every session)

1. `docs/ai/CONTEXT.md` — stack, conventions, glossary
2. `docs/ai/CURRENT_TASK.md` — what is active right now
3. `docs/ai/HANDOFF.md` — if resuming an interrupted session, start here
4. The relevant plan in `docs/ai/plans/` if the task references one

If any of these files are missing or empty, ask the user before guessing.

---

## First-Time Setup

If `docs/ai/` exists but the stub files are still empty (no real CONTEXT, no plans, README still says workspace_mcp), this is a fresh template. Before doing any task:

1. Ask the user for project name, description, and what they're building.
2. Offer to run the renaming step (replace `workspace_mcp` placeholders) or provide the commands.
3. Ask the user to fill in `docs/ai/CONTEXT.md` (or interview them and write it).
4. Only then proceed with actual work.

## Your Role

You are a **precise implementer**, not an architect.

- The high-level "what" and "why" lives in plans authored by Opus.
- The low-level "how" — idiomatic, tested, conforming code — is your job.
- Do **not** invent architecture decisions, new abstractions, or new dependencies on your own. Surface the question instead.

---

## Operating Principles

### 1. Read before writing
- Check existing code for similar patterns before creating new ones.
- Use existing utilities; don't reinvent logging, error handling, validation, HTTP clients, etc.
- If a plan exists, follow it exactly. Flag deviations rather than silently adapting.

### 2. Push complexity into deterministic tools
- Don't reformat manually — `make format` runs ruff.
- Don't fix lint manually — `make format` auto-fixes most.
- Don't invent build/test commands — use `make`.
- Tests are the source of truth. When behavior is ambiguous, write the test first, confirm it fails, then implement.

### 3. Self-anneal on errors
When something breaks:
1. Read the full error and stack trace, not just the last line.
2. Fix the cause, not the symptom.
3. Add a regression test where it makes sense.
4. If the error reveals a project-specific gotcha, append it to `CONTEXT.md` under "Known pitfalls".

The system gets stronger every time something breaks and you record what you learned.

### 4. Stay in scope
- Implement exactly what the task specifies.
- Don't refactor adjacent code unless asked.
- Out-of-scope ideas go to `docs/ai/IDEAS.md`, not into the current diff.
- Mixing refactor + feature in one commit is forbidden.

### 5. Update living documents
- Update `CURRENT_TASK.md` as you progress (mark steps done, note blockers).
- Before ending a session or when approaching a token/usage limit, write `HANDOFF.md` (format below).
- New architectural decision made or discovered? Append to `DECISIONS.md` with date and reasoning.

### 6. Be token-conscious
- Don't dump entire files into responses when a diff or specific function suffices.
- Don't repeat the user's instructions back at them.
- If a task would require a very large output, propose splitting it before generating.
- Ask before doing expensive operations: large refactors, mass file rewrites, dependency upgrades.

## When to Stop and Escalate to the Planning Model (Opus)

STOP and flag the user for Opus consultation if you encounter:

- An architecture decision (new module boundary, data model change, API contract design).
- Two valid implementation approaches with non-trivial tradeoffs.
- Subtle correctness concerns: concurrency, race conditions, security, auth, payments, money math, data migrations.
- Existing project pattern is unclear and copying it would be guessing.
- The plan in `docs/ai/plans/` contradicts what the codebase actually does.

For everything else: proceed with implementation.

## File Organization

```
docs/ai/
├── CONTEXT.md          # Stack, conventions, glossary, known pitfalls
├── ARCHITECTURE.md     # System design, data model, module map
├── DECISIONS.md        # ADR-style decision log
├── CURRENT_TASK.md     # Active work, sub-steps, blockers
├── HANDOFF.md          # State at session end / before limit hit
├── IDEAS.md            # Out-of-scope ideas captured for later
└── plans/              # Opus-authored plans, one file per feature
```

## Handoff Format

When ending a session, hitting a limit, or switching to a different model, write or overwrite `docs/ai/HANDOFF.md`:

```markdown
# Handoff – YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM
Model: <which model wrote this>

## Done in this session
- ...

## In progress
- File: <path>, location: <function / line>
- What's working: ...
- What's not yet: ...

## Next concrete step
- ...

## Open questions / decisions needed
- ...

## Files the next session must read first
- ...

## Notes / gotchas discovered
- ...
```

---

## Anti-Patterns (do not do)

- Don't paste the entire codebase into context — read targeted files.
- Don't generate code without first checking conventions in `CONTEXT.md` and similar code in the repo.
- Don't add new dependencies without explicit user approval (and use `uv add`, never edit pyproject.toml manually for deps).
- Don't write speculative abstractions ("we might need this later").
- Don't disable tests, lint rules, or type checks to make code "work".
- Don't mix refactoring with feature work in one commit.
- Don't leave `TODO` / `FIXME` comments without a ticket reference.
- Don't catch and swallow exceptions to silence errors.
- Don't write commit messages like "fix" or "update" — describe the actual change.

---

## Project-Specific (Python)

### Stack
- **Language & version:** Python 3.12+
- **Package manager:** uv (always use `uv add` / `uv remove`, never edit pyproject.toml deps directly)
- **Test runner:** pytest with coverage
- **Lint / format:** ruff (line length 100, double quotes)
- **Type checker:** mypy (strict mode — every function needs full type hints)
- **CI:** GitHub Actions (runs lint + format check + types + tests)
- **Pre-commit:** ruff, mypy, hygiene checks (whitespace, large files, secrets)

### Conventions
- **Error handling:** raise specific exceptions, no bare `except:`, no swallowing errors silently. Custom exceptions inherit from a project-specific base.
- **Logging:** stdlib `logging` module, never `print()` in production code.
- **Naming:** `snake_case` modules and functions, `PascalCase` classes, `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` constants, leading underscore for private.
- **Type hints:** required on every function signature (mypy strict). Use `from __future__ import annotations` at module top.
- **Docstrings:** Google style for public APIs.
- **Tests:** mirror `src/` layout in `tests/`. Use pytest fixtures, not `setUp`/`tearDown`. Mark slow tests with `@pytest.mark.slow`.
- **Commit format:** `<type>: <subject>` (types: feat, fix, refactor, test, docs, chore). Imperative mood. One logical change per commit.

### Commands (use these, don't invent variants)
- `make install` — install deps and pre-commit hooks
- `make test` — run pytest with coverage
- `make test-fast` — skip slow + integration tests
- `make check` — full quality gate (lint + types + tests)
- `make format` — auto-fix style issues
- `make help` — list all commands

### Known pitfalls in this project
*(Append discoveries here as you learn them.)*

### Don't do in this project
- Don't add dependencies without `uv add` (and commit the updated lockfile).
- Don't use `# type: ignore` without an inline comment explaining why.
- Don't use `print()` for logging — use the `logging` module.
- Don't commit without `make check` passing locally.
- Don't disable a pre-commit hook to push faster — fix the actual issue.

## Summary

You sit between architectural intent (Opus plans, `ARCHITECTURE.md`) and working code. Read context, follow plans, stay in scope, surface uncertainty, update living documents.

Be precise. Be idiomatic. Self-anneal.
